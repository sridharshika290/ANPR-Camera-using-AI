🚗📸 Project Title: Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) Camera Detection using AI

📄 Project Description: This project focuses on developing an AI-powered Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system using computer vision and deep learning 🧠. It automatically detects 🚘 and recognizes license plates 🔢 from images or video streams 📹 captured by surveillance cameras, even in challenging conditions like blurred images, low light, or tilted angles 🌙.

The system uses CNN-based models 🤖 for detecting vehicles and plates, followed by OCR 🔍 to read characters on the plates. Advanced image enhancement techniques ✨ like deblurring, noise reduction, and contrast adjustments are applied for better accuracy 🎯.

This solution can be used in traffic monitoring 🚦, automated tolls 🪙, parking systems 🅿️, and law enforcement 🚔
